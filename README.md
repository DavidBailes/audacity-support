## Plugin formats supported by Audacity

### Nyquist plugins

Audacity has built-in support for Nyquist effects on all operating systems. You can download additional Nyquist plug-ins, or create your own using the [Nyquist programming language](http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Nyquist\_Plug-ins\_Reference). Nyquist code can be conveniently tested using "[Nyquist Prompt](http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/nyquist\_prompt.html)" under the Effect menu.

### &#x20;**LV2 plugins**

Audacity has built-in support for [LV2](http://lv2plug.in/) plug-ins, which are an extensible successor of LADSPA effects. LV2 plug-ins are mostly built for Linux, but Audacity supports LV2 on all operating systems. To install LV2 plug-ins, place them in the [system LV2 location](http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/effect\_menu.html#LV2\_effects) then use the Plug-ins Manager to enable the new plug-ins as in the plug-in installation instructions.

### &#x20;**VST plugins**

Audacity can load VST effects (but not VST instruments) on all operating systems.&#x20;

### VST3 plugins

Starting with Audacity 3.2, VST3 effects are also supported on all operating systems.&#x20;

### Audio Unit plugins

On Mac OS X only, you can add [Audio Unit](http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Audio\_Units) plug-ins to the [system plug-in directories](http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/effect\_menu.html#add\_audio\_unit).

### LADSPA plugins

LADSPA is superseded by LV2. These plug-ins are mostly built for Linux, but some old LADSPA plugins are available via the [Legacy Windows](http://www.audacityteam.org/download/legacy-windows/) and [Legacy Mac](http://www.audacityteam.org/download/legacy-mac/) sections.
