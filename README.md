# Audacity Plugins

You can download and install plugins or libraries to add extra functionality to Audacity. Plugins can give you extra effects, or more audio generation and analysis capability.

This site features various Plugins for Audacity, categorized in the sidebar. If you want to try out many plugins, the easiest way to get them is to install entire plugin suites.

## Plugin formats

### Nyquist plugins

Audacity has built-in support for Nyquist effects on all operating systems. You can download additional Nyquist plug-ins, or create your own using the [Nyquist programming language](http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Nyquist\_Plug-ins\_Reference). Nyquist code can be conveniently tested using "[Nyquist Prompt](http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/nyquist\_prompt.html)" under the Effect menu.

### &#x20;**LV2 plugins**

Audacity has built-in support for [LV2](http://lv2plug.in/) plug-ins, which are an extensible successor of LADSPA effects. LV2 plug-ins are mostly built for Linux, but Audacity supports LV2 on all operating systems. To install LV2 plug-ins, place them in the [system LV2 location](http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/effect\_menu.html#LV2\_effects) then use the Plug-ins Manager to enable the new plug-ins as in the plug-in installation instructions.

### &#x20;**VST plugins**

Audacity can load VST effects (but not VST instruments) on all operating systems. Starting with Audacity 3.2, VST3 effects also are supported.

### Audio Unit plugins

On Mac OS X only, you can add [Audio Unit](http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Audio\_Units) plug-ins to the [system plug-in directories](http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/effect\_menu.html#add\_audio\_unit).

### LADSPA plugins

LADSPA is superseded by LV2. These plug-ins are mostly built for Linux, but some old LADSPA plugins are available via the [Legacy Windows](http://www.audacityteam.org/download/legacy-windows/) and [Legacy Mac](http://www.audacityteam.org/download/legacy-mac/) sections.
