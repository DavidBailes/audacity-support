# Audacity 3.6

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/f5TXPUOFH6A" %}

## Major changes

### Master effects

Audacity now features master effects. Master effects are effects which apply to the entire project at once. More information can be found at [using-realtime-effects.md](../../audio-editing/using-realtime-effects.md "mention").

### New compressor and limiter

A new compressor and limiter has been added, replacing the previous versions. A gain reduction history has been added to these effects when they're used as a [realtime effect](../../audio-editing/using-realtime-effects.md).&#x20;

Factory Presets suitable for a wide range of use cases for these effects have been provided by Vladislav Isaev and Marek Iwaszkiewicz, available via the Presets & Settings button.

### New themes

Audacity now features new and improved dark and light themes. You can switch between themes via Preferences -> Interface. The theme previously used still is around as the Classic theme, and themes even older than that can be optionally [installed as custom themes](../../basics/customizing-audacity/using-themes.md#installing-custom-themes) from [here](https://github.com/LWinterberg/classicTheme).

Updated instructions on creating custom themes can be found [here](https://audacity.gitbook.io/dev/scripting/creating-custom-themes).

### Increased performance

Audacity is now quite a bit snappier than before, especially when working on larger projects and on larger screens.
