# New features in Audacity 2.3.2

**This page is an overview of the key new functionality that has been introduced in Audacity 2.3.2**

* Details of all the major changes since 2.3.1 can be found in [.](./ "mention").

### LAME is now built-in in Audacity for Windows and Mac

The LAME library, which is needed for exporting MP3 audio files, is now built-in to Audacity on Windows and macOS as a part of the application.

_With previous releases it was necessary to download and locate the LAME library as an optional extra._

If you go to **Libraries Preferences** you will see that the option to locate the library is no longer there and the dialog tells you what version of LAME is built-in.

{% hint style="warning" %}
LAME is not built into Audacity on Linux - you will still need to acquire an locate the optional LAME library.
{% endhint %}

### **Select** button in Track Control Panel

There is now a Select button in the **Track Control Panel**.

The whole of an individual track can be selected by clicking this Select button.

Holding Ctrl _(or âŒ˜ + A on a Mac)_ and clicking on the Select button toggles the selectedness of the track.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can still select a whole track in the previous ways if that is what you are used to:

* Click in the neutral gray area of the Track Control Panel _(this is hard when the tracks are reduced size, as in this image)_
* Double-click in the track.
{% endhint %}

### Nyquist Plug-in Installer

The new **Nyquist Plug-in Installer** is itself a Nyquist plug-in. It simplifies the installation of other Nyquist plug-ins. It is installed by default in Audacity and can be found in the Tools Menu. It can be accessed by: **Tools > Nyquist Plug-in Installer...**

This plug-in installer provides a file browser for selecting the plug-in '.NY' file _(Nyquist plug-ins are plain text files that have the_ [_filename extension_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename\_extension) _'.NY')_, and then copies the file to the correct location.

<figure><img src="../../../../../../.gitbook/assets/nyquist plugin installer.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Nyquist plug-in installer</p></figcaption></figure>

Once the plug-in has been installed, in order to use it it must be enabled using the [Plug-in Manager](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/manage\_effects\_generators\_and\_analyzers.html).

### Macros - "cleaned" folder renamed to "macro-output"

The folder that is created by Audacity when running a Macro on files, or when an Export command is used in a Macro that is run on the current project, has been renamed to "**macro-output**" to give it a more meaningful name.

The created folder used to be called "cleaned" _(which was a hangover from functionality that used to be in Audacity, bit was removed many versions ago)_.

### mod-script-pipe provided with Audacity on Windows and Mac

{% hint style="info" %}
The add-on module "mod-script-pipe" provides a programming interface that allows Audacity to be controlled by an external program or from the command line. When enabled, mod-script-pipe intercepts scripting commands that are sent to it from an external program (usually [Python](https://www.python.org/)) via a [named pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named\_pipe).
{% endhint %}

The experimental **mod-script-pipe** is now available with Audacity for Windows and Mac. You need to enable it in Modules Preferences.

### Preference for "Type to create a label"

The default setting for the "Type to create a label" in **Tracks Behaviors Preferences** has been changed from "on" to "off".

When enabled "on", if there is already a label track that has the yellow focus border, you do not need to use "Add Label at Selection" or its **Ctrl + B** shortcut to create a new label. Just type your required label text to create a new label at the position of the editing cursor or selection region.

The change was made as some users were confused by: a) shortcuts not working when the label track has focus b) labels not being created when the label track did not have focus.

This will not affect any previous setting that you have, or have made, for this Preference unless you chose to have your preferences reset as part of an upgrade installation.

### Size restrictions on WAV and AIFF exports

WAV and AIFF audio files are size limited to a maximum of 4 GB. This is a general restriction and not an Audacity restriction.

In earlier versions of Audacity if you exported a WAV or AIFF file that would exceed those limits the file would be corrupted and truncated and this would happen without warning.

For 2.3.2 we have implemented an error trap to catch this and stop it happening. Now when attempting to export an oversized WAV or AIFF file Audacity will not do this and you will get the following error message:

<figure><img src="../../../../../../.gitbook/assets/export error.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Error message when exporting WAV o AIFF file greater than 4GB</p></figcaption></figure>

Clicking on the ? Help button in the message will show the following table in the Manual

#### Aproximate maximum time durations for WAV and AIFF files

| **Sample Format** | **Stereo** | **Mono** |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 16-bit (default)  | 6h:45m     | 13h:31m  |
| 24-bit            | 4h:30m     | 9h:01m   |
| 32-bit            | 3h:22m     | 6h:45m   |

{% hint style="info" %}
These timings are the theoretical maximum times. You would be well-advised to restrict yourself to slightly lower limits to afford some head-room.
{% endhint %}
