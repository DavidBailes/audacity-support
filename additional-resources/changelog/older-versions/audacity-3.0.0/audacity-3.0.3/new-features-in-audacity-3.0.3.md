# New features in Audacity 3.0.3

**This page is an overview of prominent new functionality that has been introduced in Audacity 3.0.3**

**Version 3.0.3 is primarily a maintenance release to fix bugs and increase the stability of the Unitary Project database structure.**

* Details of all the major changes since 3.0.2 can be found in [.](./ "mention").

### The Windows version of Audacity is now 64-bit

For the first time, Audacity will now install as a 64-bit application on Windows devices. Due to this change, some processes and effects (e.g. certain sound generation processes & sliding stretch) will run much faster.

**64-bit FFmpeg library:** If you are a user of previous Audacity versions on Windows and had installed the optional FFmpeg library then you _**must**_ now install the 64-bit versions of the FFmpeg library, otherwise your imports and exports that depend upon FFmpeg will no longer work. See **Installing FFmpeg for Windows** for installation details.

Installing the 64-bit FFmpeg library will not overwrite or delete your 32-bit FFmpeg library if you have one installed.

{% hint style="danger" %}
As Audacity is now a 64-bit application, 32-bit plug-ins will _**not work**_ on Audacity 3.0.3 or later.
{% endhint %}

### New colorways for Spectrograms

A new colorway has been introduced on Audacity 3.0.3 for Spectrograms.

The image below shows a sample track in Spectrogram view with a spectral selection:

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>This is now the new default colorway for Spectrograms in Audacity.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Classic colorway

If you wish to revert to the former colorway just go to and choose the **Spectrograms** tab and from there in the **Scheme** dropdown menu select **Color (classic)**.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Use Preferences window to revert to the former colorway</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Additional grayscale

In addition to the **Grayscale** which was available as a choice for Spectrogram displays in earlier versions of Audacity there is now also an **Inverse grayscale**.

This too can be selected from the **Scheme** field in Spectrograms Preferences.

### Display of Track Name

A new command has been added to the **View** menu, **View > Track Name (on / off)**

When this is enabled the audio track name is displayed superimposed translucently at top left of all audio tracks.

Note that the track name is always shown in the Track Control Panel but will be truncated if the name is too long to fit.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Audacity can display the track name as an overlay in the timeline</p></figcaption></figure>

This has the same effect as the setting for **Show track name as overlay** in **Tracks Preferences**.

### Update checking

Audacity will now check for updates to see if a new update of Audacity is available. This is done on launch and then after every 12 hours while Audacity remains open.

The first time that you launch Audacity 3.0.3 you will see this dialog:

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Audacity will check if there are updates available</p></figcaption></figure>

The dialog has a direct link to **Application Preferences** enabling you to turn update checking "**off**" in order to [opt-out](new-features-in-audacity-3.0.3.md#opt-out) of update checking.

This is _**not**_ an automatic update, update does not happen without you choosing to do so from the update checking dialog that appears when a new update is available.

This has long been one of the most-requested feature requests submitted by users to Audacity and it has finally been implemented.

#### Opt-out

You can opt-out of update checking by using a new preference in **Application Preferences** where you can turn this "**off**" or "**on**" at any time, the default setting is "**on**".

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Opt-out update checking</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
The setting you make in **Application Preferences** for update checking is _**not**_ changed by Reset Configuration.

* But if you manually reset by deleting the audacity.cfg file in your Audacity settings folder this will get reset to "on" on next launch of Audacity.
* You will also get shown the update checking dialog again.
{% endhint %}

### Automated crash and error reporting

Now if and when Audacity crashes, or produces an error, there will be a dialog to enable you to optionally send error and crash reports back to the developers and Quality Assurance.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>You can optionally send a report when Audacity crashes</p></figcaption></figure>

Not all error messages have the ability to automatically send back information to the developers and Quality Assurance.

### New official binary for Linux

We now provide an official binary for Linux in the form of an AppImage.

### Updating from Audacity 2.x to Audacity 3.x

With the release of Audacity 3.0.0 the project file structure of Audacity was changed significantly with the entire project contained in a single unified database file.

If you have already updated to 3.0.0 or 3.0.2 you should already be aware of this.

But if you are updating from any earlier 2.x Audacity version please read [**Updating from Audacity 2.x to Audacity 3.x**](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/updating\_from\_audacity\_2.x\_to\_audacity\_3.html).

**Older Projects:**

Audacity 3.x can usually open AUP files created in older 2.x.x versions of Audacity , but saving the project in 3.x will prevent it opening again in Audacity versions prior to 3.0.0.

* Note that this will leave behind the old **AUP** file and its associated **\_data** folder which you will probably want to delete to recover disk space.
* Audacity version 3.x should be able to open projects from Audacity 1.1 onwards - but not from 1.0
