# ðŸ†• Changing pitch

## Changing pitch per clip

You can change the pitch of a clip by selecting the clip, and then pressing **Alt+â†“â†‘** to change the pitch by a semitone. Alternatively, you also can click on the overflow menu (...) in the top right of the clip, and then **Pitch and Speed...** to change it via a dialog. You can also use the dialog to change the pitch by cents instead of just semitones.

Once you have changed the pitch, the clip will have an indication of how much it's been changed:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/clip pitch indicator" alt=""><figcaption><p>The clip pitch indicator shows that the pitch has been raised by 4 semitones.</p></figcaption></figure>

You can change or reset pitch at any time by clicking on the indicator.&#x20;

## Pitch correction of an entire track (Auto-Tune)

&#x20;While Audacity does not have any pitch correction natively, you can use plugins such as [MuseFX PitchFix](https://www.musehub.com/) for this task. See [using-realtime-effects.md](using-realtime-effects.md "mention") and [installing-plugins.md](../basics/customizing-audacity/installing-plugins.md "mention")on how to use these plugins.

## Changing pitch for an arbitrary audio selection
