# ðŸ†• Using master effects & realtime effects



## Adding effects to a track

You can add realtime effects using the following steps:

</div>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Realtime effects always apply to an entire track. Since they're calculated realtime, they won't change the source waveform.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Adding effects to all tracks (Master effects)

To add master effects, first **open the realtime effects panel** (Shortcut: `E`). At the bottom of the panel, you'll find a **Master Effects** section.&#x20;

Master effects are effects which are applied to the master mix (that is, after all the individual tracks in the project are mixed together, with any per-track realtime effects as well as gain and pan faders applied).&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Tips & Tricks:

* For music, use a little reverb on the master to make the project sound a little less "dry".&#x20;
* You can put a limiter on the master to prevent clipping. Limiters do distort the audio a little, but not as badly as clipping would.&#x20;
* You can adjust the loudness of your entire mix in this stage and do other tweaks to make the audio sound better - this is called "mastering".

## Changing effect settings

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/effects panel effect focus.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can change the effect settings by clicking on the effect's name. This will open a settings window, often with a graphical interface which looks nothing like Audacity itself. You still can interact with the main Audacity window while the effect settings are open.

## Bypassing an effect

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/effects bypasses.png" alt="the stack bypass is the first thing in focus when opening the effects panel. pressing down nagivates to any present effects. Pressing then tab first selects the power button"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can press the blue power button next to an effect (or the entire effects stack) to bypass it, causing it to be not applied to your audio.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** If you want to completely remove an effect from the stack, **press the triangle** next to the effect name and select "**No Effect**".&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Applying an effect stack to the waveform

It generally is not necessary to apply the effect stack. The stack is automatically applied when [**exporting the audio**](../basics/saving-and-exporting-projects.md#exporting-audio).&#x20;

That said, you can apply the effect stack to the waveform by first selecting the track and then going to **Tracks > Mix > Mix and Render**.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Caution:** When selecting several tracks at once, the Mix and Render option will mix all tracks together.&#x20;

Master effects are only rendered when exporting the file.
{% endhint %}

## Getting more effects

While Audacity doesn't yet ship with many realtime effects, you can download plugins for it. Currently supported plugin formats are **Audio Units** (macOS only), **VST3**, **VST**, **LV2**, and **LADSPA**. You can get many of these effects via the Muse Hub, and we have collected some plugins at [plugins.audacityteam.org](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MhmG2mhIIHTtQPuHV\_k/s/klCVENFte0GRy5IqVz0W/). Once you install the plugins, they should be detected by Audacity once you restart it, if not, see the [installation instructions](../basics/customizing-audacity/installing-plugins.md).&#x20;
