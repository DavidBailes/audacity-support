# Adding plugins to this site

If you'd like to contribute first make a gitbook account and then go to [https://www.audacityteam.org/gitbook-plugins](https://www.audacityteam.org/gitbook-plugins) to get access to the Plugin space. From there, editing [works the same as described in the user guides section](https://support.audacityteam.org/community/contributing/tutorials).

Alternatively, you can also make a pull request to the [plugins branch on audacity support](https://github.com/audacity/audacity-support/tree/plugins) on Github.

## Requirements for Plugins

* Plugins must work in the current version of Audacity.&#x20;
* Paid plugins are not allowed at this point.&#x20;

## Requirements for Entries

Generally, a plugin entry should look like this:&#x20;

_###################################################_

## _Name of Plugin_

_A short description of what the plugin is good for._

{% embed url="https://example.org" %}
_Download page_
{% endembed %}

<details>

<summary><em>Details</em></summary>

_Additional info, such as developer name, license and copyright info, a short "how to use" section or link to the documentation page, or a screenshot of the plugin - preferably of it working withing Audacity._

\[screenshot, if applicable]



</details>

_#####################################################_

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** When editing through pull requests on Github, note that Gitbook uses additional formatting tags than available in standard-markdown, so your preview might not match what'll be shown to users eventually.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
