# ðŸ†• Enabling music view

## Setting up for music workflows

You can enable a more musical view in Audacity as follows:&#x20;

1. Right-click the Timeline Ruler and select **Beats and Measures**. \
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/timeline beats.png>)
2. In the Time widget, select **beats**, or for more subdivisions, **beats and 16th**. \
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/time toolbar beats.png>)
3. Enable Snapping, and set the snapping interval to a musical option (eg 1/4, 1/8 or 1/16).\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/snap to 16.png>)

Once you have enabled all of them, your Audacity may look something like this:

## Benefits of music view

Music view is useful to help you [align pieces of music to beats and measures](aligning-music-to-beats-and-measures.md).&#x20;

It also automatically adjusts the tempo of newly imported files to fit your project tempo.
