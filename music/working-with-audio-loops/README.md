# Working with audio loops

## Getting loops

You can find loops all around the internet, including [Muse Hub](https://www.musehub.com/).&#x20;

You also can manually convert a section of a song to a loop. &#x20;

{% endcontent-ref %}

## Adjusting loops to the project

When importing a loop to the project, Audacity will automatically attempt to match the tempo. If it's unable to, you can instead adjust the tempo yourself by holding `Alt` (macOS: `Option)`and dragging the edge of a clip to stretch it to fit.

{% endcontent-ref %}

Additionally, if the loop is in a different key to your project, you can also select a clip, and press `Alt+â†“â†‘` to adjust the pitch by semitones.&#x20;

## Repeating loops

Audacity does not feature a looping feature as known from traditional DAWs at this point. Instead, you can repeat via **copy-pasting** the loop, or using the **Effects -> Special -> Repeat** effect.&#x20;
