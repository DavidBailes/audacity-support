# Generator Plugins

These are optional plug-in audio generators for Audacity. They are written in the [Nyquist programming language](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/nyquist.html). To install Nyquist plug-ins, see [this page](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/customization.html#plug-ins) in the Manual.

"Generate Plugins" appear in the Audacity [Generate menu](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/generate\_menu.html). Plugins that generate audio will usually be in this menu. This is the only type of Nyquist plug-in that does not require a selection to be made prior to applying the plug-in.
