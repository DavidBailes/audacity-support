## U-he Protoverb

A natural sounding reverb based on the concept of a room simulator

<details>

<summary>Details</summary>

Information from the developer website:

Protoverb is an experimental room simulator reverb. Most algorithmic reverbs try to avoid resonances or model the reflections of sound from a roomâ€™s walls. Protoverb does the opposite. It builds up as many room resonances as possible, modelling the body of air in the room. No need to modulate or colour the signal. The result is a very natural sounding reverberation with interesting characteristics:

Notes held for a longer time tend to build up resonance, as if the air takes a while to get excited Multiple instruments remain distinct, without disappearing in a wash When you play a short melody, the room seems to repeat a ghost echo of that melody These properties are found in churches and large halls, but are rarely in conventional algorithmic reverbs.

To achieve this, Protoverb works with many parallel, serial and networked delays. With such a structure, no mathematical formula can make it sound right, it is down to trial and error (and luck) using random values. Protoverb generates random delay line lengths, networks and feedback strategies.

## Valhalla Supermassive

ValhallaSupermassive lets you create massive reverbs, harmonic echoes and space sounds

<details>

<summary>Details</summary>

Information from the developer website:

ValhallaSupermassive is based around feedback delay networks. The individual delays can have up to 2 second of delay time, with user control over the delay lengths, the feedback, how the delays mix with each other, and the modulation rate and depth of the delays. The sonic results range from choruses and flangers, to echoes that fade in and out over time, to massive lush reverbs, and onwards to weird spatial effects that have to be heard to be believed.
