* It's a simulation of a tape delay built and marketed during the seventies, so don't expect high fidelity
* The tape produces hum and hiss, this can't be disabled
* It can easily reach a state of self-oscillation (when the feedback is too high) and distort the sound in a transistor-fashioned way
* It's also worth noticing that the real unit is way more aggressive when it comes to noise and distortion... we tried to keep it usable
* not to forget that the real unit can change sound and behavior in time, as the tape loop degrades itself until becoming unusable
* of course there's no host tempo sync
* since all imperfections have been simulated, you'll notice that the tape “slips” when the junction passes around the capstan, and you'll probably also notice that the tape speed isn't really stable
* the tone knob works reversed: turn clockwise to darken the sound

Information from the developer website:

* **Three delay modes** : single, ping pong and dual / stereo.
* Standard delay effects controls such as the delay time in ms and in time subdivisions, the feedback (up to 110 % !), a tap tempo button etc.
* A modulation section acting on the delay times and the filter cutoff frequencies.
* An attack control allowing the user to feed the delay line only when the input volume is higher than a given threshold.
* A **spring reverb** modeled from a famous tape machine (not that one, another one).
* An advanced filtering section including standard lowpass and highpass filters, shelf filters, and the simulation of two famous synthesizer filters (not these ones either, other ones).
* A specific "modeling" section giving access to different kind of delay line and saturation colourations, featuring a bitcrusher and a tube preamp simulation.
* A "Freeze" switch which can be used for some creative effect or to transform the effect into a looper with high delay values.
* Post effects such as extra filters, a tremolo and a vintage phaser

## Dragonfly Reverb

A collection of room, hall and plate reverb plugins developed by Michael Willis

<details>

<summary>Details</summary>

Information from the developer website:

Dragonfly Room Reverb is a free stereo-to-stereo reverb effect. It has several different room presets, as well as a small number of hall presets and effect presets. It is based on ProG Reverb from Freeverb3VST, which uses Moorer's early reflection model and an implementation of Jon Dattorro's Progenitor Reverb algorithm.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Dragonfly example.png>)

Dragonfly Hall Reverb is a free stereo-to-stereo reverb effect. It is primarily intended for use as a concert hall reverb. It also has numerous smaller presets representing rooms, studios, and chambers. It is based on Hibiki Reverb from Freeverb3VST, which uses Moorer's early reflection model and a modified FDN allpass Zita reverb.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/dragonfly hall example.png>)

Dragonfly Plate is a free mono-to-stereo reverb plugin based on [NVerb](http://freeverb3vst.osdn.jp/tutorial/tutorial\_vst\_nrev.shtml) and [STRev](http://freeverb3vst.osdn.jp/tutorial/tutorial\_vst\_strev.shtml) from Freeverb3 VST

## U-he Protoverb

A natural sounding reverb based on the concept of a room simulator

{% embed url="https://u-he.com/products/protoverb/" %}

<details>

<summary>Details</summary>

Information from the developer website:

Protoverb is an experimental room simulator reverb. Most algorithmic reverbs try to avoid resonances or model the reflections of sound from a room’s walls. Protoverb does the opposite. It builds up as many room resonances as possible, modelling the body of air in the room. No need to modulate or colour the signal. The result is a very natural sounding reverberation with interesting characteristics:

Notes held for a longer time tend to build up resonance, as if the air takes a while to get excited Multiple instruments remain distinct, without disappearing in a wash When you play a short melody, the room seems to repeat a ghost echo of that melody These properties are found in churches and large halls, but are rarely in conventional algorithmic reverbs.

To achieve this, Protoverb works with many parallel, serial and networked delays. With such a structure, no mathematical formula can make it sound right, it is down to trial and error (and luck) using random values. Protoverb generates random delay line lengths, networks and feedback strategies.

## Valhalla Supermassive

ValhallaSupermassive lets you create massive reverbs, harmonic echoes and space sounds

{% embed url="https://valhalladsp.com/shop/reverb/valhalla-supermassive/" %}

{% endembed %}

<details>

<summary>Details</summary>

Information from the developer website:

ValhallaSupermassive is based around feedback delay networks. The individual delays can have up to 2 second of delay time, with user control over the delay lengths, the feedback, how the delays mix with each other, and the modulation rate and depth of the delays. The sonic results range from choruses and flangers, to echoes that fade in and out over time, to massive lush reverbs, and onwards to weird spatial effects that have to be heard to be believed.
